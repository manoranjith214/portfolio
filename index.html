    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <p id="line">
        I am a dedicated and enthusiastic student currently pursuing my studies in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science,
        with a strong passion for technology and continuous learning. I have a growing interest in web development and enjoy
        creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly designs using HTML and CSS. Alongside my academics, I actively work on
        improving my programming, analytical, and problem-solving skills through practical projects and self-learning.
        I am always eager to explore new tools, technologies, and concepts that enhance my technical knowledge and real-world
        understanding. I value discipline, consistency, and effective time management, which help me balance academic
        responsibilities and personal skill development. I am comfortable working both independently and as part of a team,
        and I believe collaboration plays a key role in achieving meaningful results. With a positive mindset and a strong
        willingness to learn, I aim to build a solid foundation for a successful career in the technology industry and
        contribute effectively to innovative and impactful projects.
